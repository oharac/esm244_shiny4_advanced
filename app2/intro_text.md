## `intro_text.md`

This is written in **Markdown** and the output from `includeMarkdown()` will show up with appropriate formatting.

That means, you can do all the fancy Markdown formatting in this file instead of inside your ui.R, so your user interface code is easier to read.  Any changes in the text can just be done on this file, instead of in ui.R, meaning less likely to break something...
